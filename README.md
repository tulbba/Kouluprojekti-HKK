# School project / Kouluprojekti - Helsingin Kirpparit Kartalla

This is school project where we made a map which has most of the flea markets located in Helsinki. This way the flea markets are quite easy to find, cause they are not
as a one list on a website, but on a map where they are easily found and located. 
We also made another page incuding a feedback form, where people can suggest flea markets that we might have missed.
